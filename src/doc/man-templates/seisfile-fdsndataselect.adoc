Times are ISO8601 formatted strings, like yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss, and may be shortened
to include only the significant fields. The remaining fields will be filled in
as either zero or max value depending on the use.
For example 2006-11-19 or 2006-11-19T06:34:21.
The special strings now and yesterday may also be used.
